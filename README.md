# **Glossary**

## General

[Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)): abstract type (i.e. no data/logic) that defines behaviour through method signatures

[Spaghetti Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code) - messy, hard to read and difficult to maintain code

[Extendable Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensibility) - adding new features easily

[Strategy pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern): Select algorithm at runtime

[Unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) - Tests individual methods/sources of logic (i.e. only testing one piece of logic, not a journey)

[Behavior-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) - tests written in plain language- commonly using Gherkin syntax - Given/When/Then

[Legacy Codebase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system) - outdated or code that is no longer updated - usually has old tech stack

[Mocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) - simulating the behaviour of objects

## Code Craftsmanship

[YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) - You aren&#39;t gonna need it

[KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) - Keep it simple, stupid

[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) - Don&#39;t repeat yourself

[Boy Scout](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OpportunisticRefactoring.html) - Leave things in a better state than you found it

## SOLID

[Single-responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle): Every class should have only **one** responsibility

[Openâ€“closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle): software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification

[Liskov substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle): Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.

[Interface segregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle): Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

[Dependency inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle): Depend upon abstractions (interfaces), not concrete classes.

[Margaret Hamilton interview](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/13/margaret-hamilton-computer-scientist-interview-software-apollo-missions-1969-moon-landing-nasa-women) - interesting interview with Maraget Hamilton regarding her work on the Apollo code and being the first female software engineer and managing an all-male team. She also talks about managing being a mother and her career.
